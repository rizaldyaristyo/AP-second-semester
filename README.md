# Notice!
##### To the public:
I'd like to apologize in advance that this was just a little project that issued by our lecturer as a final project on our 2nd semester, as you'd expect the code would be so bad arranged and copasted so much, as we at the time have little to none knowledge about the subject itself.
##### To my group members:
please Request Push Access to me via any contact first so you may collaborate to this project
